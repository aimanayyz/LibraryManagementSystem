# LibraryManagementSystem
Library Management System – C++ Project
This is a Library Management System developed in C++ as part of an academic project. The system simulates the working of a real library, built using core Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts including linked lists, binary search trees (BST), maps, and arrays — without relying on any external databases or STL containers (except map).

The system provides role-based access with three user types: Visitor, Registered User, and Admin, each with its own set of features and privileges.

🧩 System Overview
👤 Visitor Features
Search and browse the book catalog by title, author, genre, ISBN

View detailed book information

Explore library events

🧑‍💻 Registered User Features
Sign up / Login system

Edit account details and preferences

Borrow books

Submit and view book reviews and ratings

🛡️ Admin Features
Full user management (add/edit/delete users, assign roles)

Book catalog management using linked lists

Event management using a Binary Search Tree (BST)

Monitor transactions and generate reports

Create, edit, delete library events

🛠️ Technical Implementation
Language: C++

Key Data Structures Used:

✅ Linked List – For managing books and users

✅ Binary Search Tree (BST) – For managing library events

✅ Map – For efficient book lookup, user credentials, or review storage (depending on use)

✅ Arrays – For storing flags, reviews, login data, etc.

Programming Concepts:

Role-based menus and access control

Manual data management without full database or STL containers

Modular, menu-driven architecture
